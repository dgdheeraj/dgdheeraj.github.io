Each of the Workers (Parent and Child) have their own copy of the database.Orchestrator uses AMQP with RabbitMQ to distribute incoming db requests to master and several slave containers. Four Queues are used for this purpose\nReadQ WriteQ SyncQ ResponseQ Orchestrator publishes all db write requests to WriteQ. All db read requests are published to ReadQ using the RPC pattern, which waits for a corresponding reply from ResponseQ.\nParent container consumes messages from WriteQ, and writes them to the database. Then the Parent publishes those messages to SyncQ which is a Fanout exchange. SyncQ is used to synchronise the child‚Äôs database with parent. All incoming read requests in the orchestrator are saved in a .txt file. When a new child is spawned, its database is synchronised using get_sql_stmts api in the Orchestrator, which retrieves the saved sql statements, all these statements are written into the database.\nChild container consumes messages from ReadQ and SyncQ. All messages from SyncQ fanout exchange are written into the Database.The requests from the ReadQ are consumed by slaves in Round-Robin fashion. All read db requests from ReadQ are executed on the database, and result is sent back on the ResponseQ.\nAuto-Scaling is implemented using BackgroundScheduler, which calls a function (auto_scale) every 2 minutes. The scheduler is started after the first Read Request. Scaling Up/Down is performed based on the number of read requests received in the previous interval.\nApache Zookeeper is used to implement Fault Tolerance in Parent and Child containers. A watch is kept on these containers and leader-election is performed if parent container is faulty.\n","date":1556668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556668800,"objectID":"e81af2a91e7d57b1589635d05b26d4c4","permalink":"https://dgdheeraj.github.io/project/dbaas/","publishdate":"2019-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/dbaas/","section":"project","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"Mini dBaaS for Rideshare APIs","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let‚Äôs make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?
